# Docker Testing

This is a very small proof of concept for running a docker environment.

This test environment contains the following containers:
- php:7.2-rc-fpm-alpine3.6
- httpd:2.4-alpine
- mysql:5.6

For more info please see `docker-compose.yml`

## To get started

If you have docker installed:

    docker-compose up -d

If you don't have docker installed - [go install it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and come right back!
